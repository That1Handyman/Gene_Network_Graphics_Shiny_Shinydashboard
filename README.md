# Transition from Shiny to Shinydashboard
Goal is to update the graphical overview of legacy shiny code to shinydashboard.
In addition, implement other dynamic graphics within the plot of the gene network.

Shinydashboard provides more layout customization and the ability to display more plotOutputs
and graphs to better represent those plots.

Legacy code had to undergo some changes in function calls.

The tab section was added to further provide researchers with other possibilities to 
present their data.

## Future work
Implementing a better network representation using the igraph package in R.
